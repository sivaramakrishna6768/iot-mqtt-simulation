# üåê Cloud-based IoT System Simulation Project
# IoT MQTT Simulation ‚Äì CIS600 Assignment 3

This project simulates a virtual environmental station that collects data from temperature, humidity, and CO‚ÇÇ sensors, and publishes this data to a ThingSpeak channel using the MQTT protocol.

It was completed as part of **CIS600 : Internet of Things - Application Development (Spring 2025)**.

## üì¶ Project Files

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `mqtt_thingspeak_publisher.py` | Simulates virtual sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, CO‚ÇÇ) and publishes it to ThingSpeak every 15 seconds using MQTT. Also logs the data locally in `sensor_log.txt`. |
| `last_5_hour_data.py` | Parses `sensor_log.txt` and prints data for a selected sensor from the last 5 hours. |
| `sensor_log.txt` | Auto-generated file storing timestamped sensor readings locally. |
| `vpalapar_Assignment_3_IoT_App_Dev.pdf` | Final submission pdf file with the brief explanation, screenshots, and reflection. |

## üì° Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **ThingSpeak (MQTT & REST API)**
- **paho-mqtt** (for MQTT communication)
- **Local File Logging** (for historical analysis)

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **ThingSpeak Setup**  
   - A channel named `Environmental Station` was created with 3 fields (Temperature, Humidity, CO‚ÇÇ).
   - An MQTT device `VirtualStation1` was configured and linked to the channel.

2. **Data Publishing**  
   - `mqtt_thingspeak_publisher.py` simulates random data and sends it to ThingSpeak every 15 seconds using MQTT.
   - The same data is also stored in a local log file with timestamps.

3. **Data Retrieval (Offline)**  
   - `last_5_hour_data.py` filters the logged data to show values from the last 5 hours for a specific sensor.
   - This demonstrates the ability to perform time-based analysis on historical data.

## üöÄ How To Run

1. **Install dependencies**
2. **Replace MQTT credentials in** `mqtt_thingspeak_publisher.py`
3. **Run the script**  
4. **Watch the live graphs on your ThingSpeak channel dashboard**
